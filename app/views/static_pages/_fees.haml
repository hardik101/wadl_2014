Unfortunately, we do not have direct access to this account. Therefore, 
registration can only be confirmed after we have evidence that the money
have been transfered to the account. We would be grateful if the participants
would support us in speeding this process up by providing a proof of payment
in any convenient format (image file, PDF). Otherwise, there is the risk that the 
receipt that you will get from the organizers will be signed by us but will not have
the official stamp of IMAR.
