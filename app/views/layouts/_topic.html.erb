<p>The <strong>21st International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques</strong> (<strong>WADT 2012</strong>) will take place in Salamanca, Spain, from 7th to 10th June, 2012.</p>

<h2>Aims and scope:</h2>
<p>The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many
  aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a formal 
  method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new 
  specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, 
  aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional 
  programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including 
  information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems).</p>

<h2>Topics of interest:</h2>
<p>Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:
<ul>
  <li>Foundations of algebraic specification</li>
  <li>Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing</li>
  <li>Specification languages, methods, and environments</li>
  <li>Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques</li>
  <li>Model-driven development</li>
  <li>Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems</li>
  <li>Integration of formal specification techniques</li>
  <li>Formal testing and quality assurance</li>
  <li>Validation and verification</li>
</ul>
</p>
